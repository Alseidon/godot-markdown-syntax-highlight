# A beautiful tale of two young men
## Michael
A pale, _very_ beautiful man with:
1. beautiful eyes
2. a long wooden bow
3. and an innocent look in his eyes.

Also, he loves escaped \_weiiird\_ things. A *l\*t*.
## And Bob
Well, Bob was a *dwarf*. Yes, a **dwarf**. But this didn't prevent Bob from being
a relentless killer, with a damn high __sex-appeal__.

### Bonuses
 - A hammer
 - A beard
 - And arms like trunks
More than enough for the trustful Michael.

> I love you, Michael.
Most famous Bob quote.

#### Even more !
What?? And he can `code in GDScript` too ??
